#10 test case that reflects the priorities of the website.
1. Home and Shop Tabs: When we go to home or shop tabs, I will check wether we are getting navigated to those tabs accordingly or if any one of the content tabs is not opening or going wrong.
2. Contact Tab: When we choose contact tab I will check if the details form is valid and all the basic questions are asked to serve the customer accurately. 
3. Login Option: I will test if the login option is being able to access and it is working correct 
4. Login Credentials: I will also check if I can give input values to login credentials and see if those input values are secured enough in a relevant format  finally check if I can login into the account and store my details.
5. Invalid login: I will test if the given input values are wrong in the login details which can be seen by users as a warning and also the check if the login pop up is getting closed after that.
6. Shopping webpage: When I select to buy any of the items I will test whether the cart is getting updated or not and show me what are the items that I have selected.  
7. Shopping cart: In the shopping cart if I buy same and repeated items I will test if the quantity is incresing or the duplicates of the items are increasing and also check the prices whether they are right and also if the total added is correct and accurate without any  pricing issues.  
8. When I am in the shopping cart there are two links including checkout and shopping. I will test whether I can navigate to those  both links or if any of the links are not working. And in the checkout link I will test if all the required details from the user are asked for the delivering the items and in the other shopping link if it going to main shopping page or not.  
9. In the contact page there is a form for the users to get in touch using their details and queries. In that I will test if the users telephone number is being taken in a correct format or not and the form is getting submitted only if all the details are filled in correct format.
10. In the checkout page and the contact page again, I will test whether the users email is taken in the correct format like checking for '@' and '.com' and giving any suggestions for example like '123@gmail.com' and also in number text box I will check if number is taken only if all of them are digits and upto 10 digits. And finally test if the form is acceptable only if all the mentioned requirements are met.
